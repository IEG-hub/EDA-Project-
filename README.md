# Trends in greenhouse gas emissions
For the project, the selected topic consists of an analysis of gas emissions over a period of years and by continent. The analysis then focused on Spain gas emissions and capital investment in environmental protection.
The data on gas emissions was downloaded from a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/README.md), and the data on capital investment was downloaded from [INE](https://ine.es/dyngs/INEbase/operacion.htm?c=Estadistica_C&cid=1254736176846&menu=resultados&idp=1254735976612#).
This data analysis constitutes a Data Science Bookcamp project. Be careful with the code â€” I'm still learning!
